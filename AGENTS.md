# Dotfiles — Agent Guide

This file provides orientation for AI agents and the known-issue backlog for this repository.

---

## Overview

A personal development environment managed with **GNU Stow**. Designed to provision a new machine in one command:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/raine-works/.dotfiles/main/setup.sh | bash
```

- **Primary platform:** macOS
- **Theme:** Tokyo Night palette in Starship prompt configuration
- **Package manager:** Homebrew
- **Config strategy:** mostly symlinks via `stow`; VS Code and Zed settings use stowed base files merged into local settings

---

## Repository Structure

Each top-level directory is a **Stow package**. The directory tree inside each package mirrors `$HOME`, so Stow can create the correct symlinks.

**Stow command used throughout:**
```bash
stow -d "$DOTFILES_DIR" -t "$HOME" --restow <package>
```

## Shell Config Layering

Understanding this chain is critical before editing any shell file.

```
~/.zshrc  (or ~/.bashrc)
  ↓  [source line injected by install.sh with marker: # dotfiles-managed:raine-works]
~/.config/shell/zshrc  (or bashrc)
  ↓  [explicit source at top of file]
~/.config/shell/shelldefs
  ↓  [glob loop: for f in tools/*.sh; do . "$f"; done]
~/.config/shell/tools/*.sh  (nvm.sh, docker.sh, kubernetes.sh, …)
```

**The injection marker** used to detect and prevent duplicate entries:
```bash
SOURCE_TAG="# dotfiles-managed:raine-works"
```

**Tool files are self-guarding** — they bail out immediately if the tool isn't installed:
```bash
# Example: docker.sh
command -v docker >/dev/null 2>&1 || return 0
```
Always follow this pattern when adding a new tool file.

**shelldefs** is sourced by both `zshrc` and `bashrc`, making it the right place for cross-shell aliases and environment variables.

## Installation Flow

### `setup.sh` (bootstrap)
1. Detects OS; installs Homebrew on macOS if missing
2. Installs base deps: `stow`, `git`, `starship`, `fzf` via Homebrew
3. Clones the repo to `~/.dotfiles`, or pulls latest if it already exists
4. Execs into `install.sh`

### `install.sh` (interactive installer)
1. Presents an arrow-key/spacebar TUI menu to select tools
2. Stows core packages: `shell`, `starship`, `gitconfig`
3. Injects `[ -f ~/.config/shell/{zshrc|bashrc} ] && source ... # dotfiles-managed:raine-works` into user's existing rc file
4. Runs selected tool installers
5. Prompts to create `~/.gitconfig.local` with name/email

### VS Code settings behavior

The `vscode` package stows `dotfiles.settings.json` into `~/Library/Application Support/Code/User/`.

`install_vscode()` then merges:
- base: `dotfiles.settings.json` (tracked in this repo)
- local: `settings.json` (user-edited, not tracked)

Local values win on merge, so in-editor settings changes do not mutate this repository.

**Flags:**
| Flag | Effect |
|------|--------|
| `--all` | Pre-select all tools, skip the menu |
| `--no-tools` | Skip tool selection entirely (stow + shell config only) |

**Re-running is safe:** `--restow` re-creates symlinks idempotently; the marker prevents double-injection of the source line.

## Key Conventions

### Adding a new tool config

1. Create `shell/.config/shell/tools/<toolname>.sh`
2. First line must be a self-guard:
   ```bash
   command -v <toolname> >/dev/null 2>&1 || return 0
   ```
3. No registration needed — `shelldefs` globs all `*.sh` files in `tools/` automatically

### Adding a new Stow package

1. Create `<packagename>/<mirror of $HOME path>/` — e.g. `foo/.config/foo/config`
2. Add the package name to the `PACKAGES` array in `install.sh`
3. Test first with dry run: `stow -n --simulate -d ~/.dotfiles -t ~ <packagename>`

### Adding a tool to the installer

1. Add one entry to the `TOOL_REGISTRY` array in `install.sh`:
   ```bash
   "<id>|Display Name|Short description"
   ```
2. Create `install_<id>()` — use `install_package` or `detect_package_manager` for multi-platform support.
3. Create `uninstall_<id>()` — use `uninstall_via_brew` for Homebrew packages; handle other managers explicitly.
4. Add a `verify_tool_installed()` case if the tool's command differs from its id.
5. Add a `is_tool_detected()` case to enable pre-selection in the TUI menu.

No array sync needed — `TOOL_IDS`, `TOOL_NAMES`, `TOOL_DESCS` are derived automatically from `TOOL_REGISTRY`.

### Adding cross-shell aliases or env vars

- Put them in `shell/.config/shell/shelldefs` (sourced by both zsh and bash)
- Shell-specific logic goes in `shell/.config/shell/zshrc` or `bashrc`

### Git identity

Stored in `~/.gitconfig.local` (git-ignored, user-local). The stowed `.gitconfig` includes it via `[include] path = ~/.gitconfig.local`.

### Editor settings merge (VS Code & Zed)

Both VS Code and Zed use a **base file + local merge** pattern:
- **Base file** (tracked): `dotfiles.settings.json` (stowed into respective config directories)
- **Local file** (user-edited, not tracked): `settings.json` 
- **Merge strategy**: Base settings + user overrides (user values always win)
- **Merge logic**: Deep merge via Python in `install.sh` called by `vscode_merge_settings()` and `zed_merge_settings()`

This allows you to edit settings in the editor without those changes bleeding into the repo.

## Testing Changes

```bash
# Dry-run stow to preview symlinks without creating them
stow -n --simulate -d ~/.dotfiles -t ~ <package>

# Re-stow a package after editing its files
stow -d ~/.dotfiles -t ~ --restow <package>

# Reload shell config without opening a new shell
exec $SHELL

# Re-run the full installer
bash ~/.dotfiles/install.sh

# Re-run with all tools selected, no menu
bash ~/.dotfiles/install.sh --all

# Re-run skipping tool selection (stow + shell config only)
bash ~/.dotfiles/install.sh --no-tools
```

## Known Issues / TODO

### Open

*(None — all known issues resolved.)*

---

### Completed (March 2026)

- **`HOST_IP` cross-platform fallback** implemented in `shell/.config/shell/shelldefs`.
- **NVM double-sourcing** fixed in `shell/.config/shell/tools/nvm.sh` by choosing one valid source path.
- **Starship `success_symbol`** already corrected in `starship/.config/starship/starship.toml`.
- **`git pull --quiet` silent failures** fixed in `setup.sh` by removing quiet mode and adding explicit failure handling.
- **Unique source marker** implemented in `install.sh` (`# dotfiles-managed:raine-works`) with legacy marker compatibility.
- **Stow failure diagnostics** improved in `install.sh` with preflight checks and explicit error messaging.
- **Kubernetes empty fzf selection feedback** implemented in `shell/.config/shell/tools/kubernetes.sh` via guarded `klp`/`klns` functions.
- **Fragile Homebrew path assumptions** removed in `setup.sh` and `install.sh` by resolving brew through `command -v`.
- **`DOTFILES_REPO` hardcoded value** replaced in `setup.sh` with environment-default override.
- **`set -e` without context** addressed in `setup.sh` and `install.sh` with line-aware ERR traps.
- **No pre-flight backup before `stow --restow`** resolved: `backup_stow_conflicts()` now creates a dated tarball of conflicting targets in `~/.dotfiles-backups/` (retains last 5), and `restore_stow_backup()` offers interactive restore on stow failure. `install.sh`.
- **Tool metadata duplication** eliminated: `TOOL_REGISTRY` single-source array replaced three parallel arrays; `TOOL_IDS`/`TOOL_NAMES`/`TOOL_DESCS` are derived automatically. `install.sh`.
- **Repetitive uninstaller boilerplate** consolidated: `uninstall_via_brew()` helper extracts brew-formula/cask uninstall logic; each uninstaller reduced to a thin wrapper. `install.sh`.
- **Post-install PATH verification** added: `verify_tool_installed()` warns (non-blocking) when a tool's command is missing from PATH after install. `install.sh`.
